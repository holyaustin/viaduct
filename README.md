## Web 3.0 technologies Used

Frontend: Vite + Vue, windicss, 

Web3 technologies:  Web3Modal,  Gnosis, Monerium
Backend: Solidity, Node.js

Blockchain deployed to:  Gnosis

## Description

This project uses a new solution for building trustless, permissionless, extensible, universal, and efficient cross-chain bridges using ZKP..

The smart contract uses ERC-721 specification to hold metadata URI, ethers.js was used to interact with the smart contract. The contract was deployed to Filecoin Hyperspace blockchain. The entire project demo was hosted to Vercel.
